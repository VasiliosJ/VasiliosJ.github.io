      <p>For nine straight mornings last December, and again in the fading light of dusk, Tammy Lacher Scully left her home in Belfast, Maine, and drove a mile to the convenience store that doubles as a bus station..</p>
    
      <p>There, she watched the passengers step off the bus from Bangor, scanning every face, knitted hat and parka. She was looking for her son Graham Lacher, 39, who had fled from a Bangor psychiatric hospital six months earlier, walked into the woods nearby and disappeared.</p>

      <p>Ms. Scully, 65, knew her son was unlikely to be on the bus. But she thought of this daily ritual as a kind of novena: a prayer repeated for nine days to appeal a misfortune or request a special favor. Getting in the car, gripping the wheel, taking action.</p>

      <p>Eighteen months after he vanished, she and her husband are still searching for Mr. Lacher, whose autism and schizophrenia were diagnosed when he was a teenager. They have crisscrossed the sprawling state of Maine, checking and rechecking dozens of homeless encampments and shelters. And  they have chased hundreds of tips from some of the 6,000 strangers who follow their search on Facebook.

</p>

      <p>Ignoring those who advise her to accept her loss, Ms. Scully has come to inhabit a limbo that is little recognized by outsiders but painfully real for the families of people who remain missing for years.



</p>

      <p>Early on, she realized it was up to her to keep the search active. And like others in her position, she is both unwilling to stop looking and unable to move on.



</p>


      <p>“I am mourning his absence,” she has gotten used to saying. “I won’t mourn his loss unless there’s solid evidence that he is gone.”

      <p>Across the United States, the number of active missing persons cases has ticked up steadily in the last five years, to 97,000 in 2022 from 85,500 in 2018. While the overall volume of missing person reports has been shrinking since the 1990s, as cellphones and other technology have made it easier to track people down, some recent research suggests an increase in the number of vulnerable people who are disappearing.
</p>


      <p>They include people without housing, victims of abuse, and those with mental illness or substance use disorders. As social problems have intensified, remote and rural places have not been spared. In Bangor, the city of 32,000 where Mr. Lacher was last seen, more unhoused people are living outdoors, where harsh winters put their lives at risk.</p>

   
      


      <p>Mr. Lacher could be eking out an invisible existence on the fringes of the city — or halfway across the country. When adults are reported missing in Maine, as in other places, search efforts by the police are typically short-lived. After that, it is often unclear whose job it is to try to find them.</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman for the Maine State Police referred questions about missing persons cases to the chief medical examiner’s office, which said it gathers “biometric information” on missing people, such as dental records, to help identify recovered remains. But it does not conduct searches. Nor does the agency track how many cases are reported and resolved each year, making it hard to discern if the problem is worsening.
</p>

      <p>A federal database, the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, was created in 2007 to record all such cases in one place. But only 13 states require the police to use it.</p>

      <p>Laura Supica, a state representative from Bangor, said she thought the police should follow clearer protocols to ensure consistency. “Not everybody has a mom like Tammy,” she said.
