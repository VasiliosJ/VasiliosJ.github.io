      <p>The Food and Drug Administration’s approval on Friday of two groundbreaking gene therapy treatments for sickle cell disease has brought a rare moment of hope and celebration to people with the agonizing blood disorder.</p>
    
      <p>But there is no clear path for the new  therapies — one-time treatments so effective in clinical trials that they have been hailed as cures — to reach the countries where the vast majority of people with sickle cell live. Shortly after the approval their manufacturers announced sticker prices in the millions of dollars: $3.1 million for Lyfgenia, made by Bluebird Bio, and $2.2 million for Casgevy, made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals.</p>

      <p>Lyfgenia will launch in the United States. Vertex has been prioritizing winning approval in six wealthy countries — the United States, Italy, Britain, France, Germany and Saudi Arabia — that, by one estimate, are home to 2 percent of the global sickle cell population.</p>

      <p>Three-quarters of the world’s sickle cell patients are in sub-Saharan Africa. Several million of them are believed to be sick enough that they would be eligible for the new therapies, compared with some 20,000 in the United States.</p>

      <p>Many African patients have been closely following news online of the treatments’ success in clinical trials. In Tanzania, information about Casgevy spread a few months ago through a WhatsApp group that Shani Mgaraganza set up for mothers of children with sickle cell. Her son, Ramadhani, 12, and daughter Nasra, 10, have the inherited disorder, which causes episodes of searing pain and damages their organs. She said the therapy sounded like a miracle.




</p>

      <p>“Everyone said, ‘Thanks God, our kids will be well,’” she said. Then the mothers learned what it was likely to cost. “It would be billions of Tanzanian shillings,” Ms. Mgaraganza said. “No one can afford this. It was demoralizing.”

</p>


      <p>The access question is front of mind for Jennifer Doudna, the University of California, Berkeley, scientist who shared a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for pioneering the gene-editing method, CRISPR, underpinning Casgevy. “Today it’s not going to be widely available,” she said. “Now that we have this approval, we need to really figure out how we’re going to open it up to more people.”

</p>

      <p>Two key factors put it out of the reach of patients in Africa. First, price: The treatments are far too expensive for governments that struggle to pay for basic health services. In some cases, there may be substantial additional costs, such as for a patient’s extended hospital stay to receive gene therapy.

</p>


      <p>The second barrier is medical infrastructure: Administering the treatment is a monthslong process at medical centers that can perform stem cell transplants. Patients must have their cells harvested and flown to a lab for manufacturing, undergo grueling chemotherapy and endure a long hospitalization.</p>

      <p>A medicine that is so resource-intensive as this is may not be appropriate in many places where the amount of resources for health care is more limited,” said Vertex’s chief scientific officer, Dr. David Altshuler.</p>

      <p>He said the company was working to develop cheaper and easier approaches to treat sickle cell patients around the world, including a simple pill, which has not yet been tested in humans. “This takes a long time to do, and I feel like we’re at the beginning of the next phase,” he said.
</p>

      <p>A Bluebird Bio spokeswoman, Jess Rowlands, said it was “the unfortunate reality” that the infrastructure needed for such gene therapies “does not exist in much of the world.” Bluebird will “continue to invest in approaches that may support global access in the future,” she said.</p>

      <p>New medicines often debut in wealthy countries years before they arrive in poorer parts of the world. The disparities have been exacerbated in recent years, as a wave of cutting-edge therapies with breathtaking price tags have transformed the lives of patients in wealthy countries. Vertex in particular has faced criticism for keeping its pioneering cystic fibrosis drugs out of reach of thousands of patients in lower-income countries.</p>
