      <p>The Texas Supreme Court on Monday overturned a lower court order allowing an abortion for a pregnant woman whose fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition, hours after her lawyers said she had decided to leave Texas for the procedure in the face of the state’s abortion bans.</p>
    
      <p>The court ruled that the lower court made a mistake in ruling that the woman, Kate Cox, who is more than 20 weeks pregnant, was entitled to a medical exception.

</p>

      <p>In its seven-page ruling, the Supreme Court found that Ms. Cox’s doctor, Damla Karsan, “asked a court to pre-authorize the abortion yet she could not, or at least did not, attest to the court that Ms. Cox’s condition poses the risks the exception requires.” Texas’ overlapping bans allow for abortions only when a pregnancy seriously threatens the health or life of the woman.</p>

      <p>“These laws reflect the policy choice that the Legislature has made, and the courts must respect that choice,” the court wrote.</p>

      <p>The ruling, which applied only to Ms. Cox’s current pregnancy, suggested that the court would not be open to readings of the law that would expand the medical exception in Texas beyond all but the most serious cases. The fact that Ms. Cox decided to leave the state rather than wait for a ruling underscored the difficulty of seeking court permission for an abortion in the midst of a pregnancy.



</p>

      <p>Ms. Cox asked the lower court for approval after she learned that her fetus had a fatal condition, and after several trips to the emergency room. Her lawyers and her doctor argued that carrying the pregnancy to term risked her health and her future ability to have children.

</p>


      <p>The legal authorization she obtained from the lower court was put on hold when Ken Paxton, the state attorney general, appealed to the Texas Supreme Court. But uncertain of when a ruling would come, her lawyers said on Monday that she had decided to seek an abortion in a state where it is legal.


</p>

      <p>“Kate desperately wanted to be able to get care where she lives and recover at home surrounded by family,” Nancy Northup, the chief executive for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which was representing Ms. Cox in her case, said in a statement. “While Kate had the ability to leave the state, most people do not, and a situation like this could be a death sentence.”
</p>


      <p>The case was believed to be the first to seek a court-ordered exception since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, clearing the way for Republican-controlled states like Texas to enact near-total bans on abortions.
</p>

   
      


      <p>It marked a new chapter in the legal history of abortion in the United States, with pregnant women now going to court seeking permission for their doctors to do what they determine to be medically necessary without fear of severe criminal or civil penalties. Legal challenges have emerged in several states where doctors said the bans were preventing abortions even in cases of serious pregnancy complications.</p>

      <p>Last week, a Kentucky woman who was eight weeks pregnant filed suit seeking to overturn that state’s bans. Ms. Cox’s case, filed last week, was unusual for being brought during her pregnancy. At the same time that the Texas Supreme Court was considering her case, it was also weighing an action brought by women and their doctors, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, seeking to clarify the limits of medical exceptions to the Texas abortion bans.
</p>

      <p>That case, Zurawski v. Texas, involves women who said they were forced to continue pregnancies, despite dangers to their health, because the vagueness of the state’s exemptions made doctors extremely cautious about when a medical condition was serious enough to allow for an abortion. Ms. Cox’s husband and Dr. Karsan, are also represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights.</p>

      <p>In its decision on Monday, the Texas Supreme Court suggested a general standard that could be applied beyond Ms. Cox’s case. “The exception does not mandate that a doctor in a true emergency await consultation with other doctors who may not be available,” the court wrote. “The exception is predicated on a doctor’s acting within the zone of reasonable medical judgment, which is what doctors do every day.”
