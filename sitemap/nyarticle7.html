      <p>A federal appeals court on Friday upheld significant portions of New York’s expansive gun law, ruling that the state can ban the carrying of guns in schools, parks and other places and deny firearms to people whom local officials deem dangerous.</p>
    
      <p>The ruling, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, came in response to four separate challenges to the law, which was passed in summer 2022 after the Supreme Court struck down an earlier law that had governed the public carrying of firearms in New York for more than a century.</p>

      <p>The new law bans the carrying of guns in so-called sensitive locations, a category that includes schools, government buildings, places of worship and Times Square. The law also requires that people who apply to carry guns in public be of “good moral character,” as determined by local licensing officials.</p>

      <p>The ruling on Friday, by a three-judge panel, was largely a victory for New York, keeping in place both the ban on guns in many of the locations outlined by the state and the “good moral character test.”


</p>

      <p>But the appeals court rejected some parts of the law, barring the state from declaring that guns are presumed to be off limits at places of worship as well as privately owned properties that are typically open to the public like gas stations and grocery stores. Under the court’s ruling, the owners of such properties must proactively signal that guns are banned.</p>


      <p>“It’s putting the burden on every property owner to affirmatively come out and tell folks they don’t want guns on the premises,” said David Pucino, the legal director of Giffords Law Center, a gun safety group.


</p>

      <p>The new law had also required applicants for gun licenses to submit a list of their social media accounts to help officials assess their character and conduct. The appeals court rejected that requirement, finding that it was most likely unconstitutional to interfere with the aliases people use when expressing their views online.



</p>


      <p>The ban on carrying guns in Times Square has been a particular point of contention. A federal judge last year ruled it unconstitutional, although the provision stayed in place during the appeals process.


</p>

   
      
       

      <p>Although the Second Circuit did not explicitly address the constitutionality of the Times Square ban in its ruling on Friday, portions of the decision suggested it would stand up to future challenges.

</p>

      <p>Overall, legal experts said, the appeals court’s ruling was among the most significant on gun regulation since the Supreme Court struck down New York’s previous law last year.
</p>

      <p>Mr. Navalny has been in custody in Russia since his detention in January 2021 in a Moscow airport, where he arrived after spending months in Germany, recovering from a poisoning by a nerve agent. Mr. Navalny blamed the Kremlin for the poisoning, but the Russian authorities denied their involvement.</p>
