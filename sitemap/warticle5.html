      <p>Iran’s most prominent human rights activist, Narges Mohammadi, was supposed to be handed the Nobel Peace Prize at a ceremony in Oslo on Sunday.</p>
    
      <p>But, locked inside Evin Prison in Iran, Ms. Mohammadi, 51, was unable to attend and her 17-year-old twin children, Kiana Rahmani and Ali Rahmani, instead accepted medal and diploma on her behalf and read out a speech she had prepared.</p>

      <p>“I write this message from behind the tall and cold walls of a prison,” she said in her speech, making a plea for a “globalization of peace and human rights” in a world where authoritarian governments continue to commit abuses against their people.

</p>

      <p>Ms. Mohammadi’s children have not seen their mother since 2015, when they fled Iran for France, and they have been unable to speak with her for two years, after Iranian prison authorities banned her from phone contact with them, according to PEN America, a free-speech group.

</p>

      <p>In the speech, which was greeted with a standing ovation, Ms. Mohammadi described the undemocratic ways of the Islamic republic, its oppressive rules mandating the hijab for women, and the women-led uprisings that shook the country last year.



</p>
She warned that human rights violations perpetrated by authoritarian governments had broader consequences, including migration, unrest and growing terrorist threats.</p>


      <p>“In the globalized world, either human rights will become respected internationally, or human rights violations will continue to spread across state borders,” she said.

</p>

      <p>A portrait of Ms. Mohammadi hung on the wall of Oslo’s city hall during the ceremony, which included performances by Iranian musicians.



</p>


      <p>In her speech, the Iranian human rights activist also talked of the “soul-crushing suffering resulting from the lack of freedom, equality, and democracy” in her country, perpetrated by a “despotic religious government.”


</p>

   
      
       

      <p>“Tyranny turns life into death, blessing into lament, and comfort into torment,” she said.</p>

      <p>Iran’s authoritarian government has long tried to silence and punish Ms. Mohammadi for her activism and she is currently serving a long prison sentence for “spreading anti-state propaganda.”</p>

      <p>On Saturday, Ms. Mohammadi’s family announced that she had begun a hunger strike to protest the violation of human rights in Iran and the treatment of the Baha’i religious minority there. She has previously suffered severe health problems in prison, including a heart attack.</p>
