      <p>The new head of New York City’s troubled jails, Lynelle Maginley-Liddie, pledged on Friday to work with the federal monitor overseeing the system to avoid a takeover of the dangerous Rikers Island complex, promising to usher in a new era of transparency and a “humane” environment for people in custody.</p>
    
      <p>Ms. Maginley-Liddie, an eight-year veteran of the Department of Correction who previously served as first deputy commissioner and chief diversity officer, said at a news conference on Friday that a federal takeover of Rikers Island was not a “foregone conclusion.” To avoid losing control of the jail, she said she would use the relationship she had developed with the monitor, Steve J. Martin.</p>

      <p>Mayor Eric Adams interrupted the news conference at City Hall to read from a newly filed status report from the monitor that praised Ms. Maginley-Liddie as “transparent and forthright” and as someone who understood “the significant work that lies ahead.”</p>

      <p>The praise was a bright moment in what has otherwise been an avalanche of bad news about Mr. Adams’s management of Rikers Island. Citing a failure to correct the dangerous conditions at the jail complex, Damian Williams, Manhattan’s top federal prosecutor, formally joined efforts last month to strip city control of the jail and place it under the authority of an outside entity, known as a receiver. Letitia James, the New York attorney general, also recently joined those efforts. Nine people have died at the jail complex this year.





</p>

      <p>The federal monitor has said that the city, including the former jails commissioner Louis A. Molina, strongly resisted efforts at reform.</p>


      <p>Mr. Martin wrote in a status report Friday that the jails still presented “a high risk of harm to those who are incarcerated” there and that he remained “concerned about the development and mismanagement by leadership of various initiatives” to fix problems.

</p>

      <p>Ms. Maginley-Liddie said her focus would be “restoration and investment in a safe, secure, humane and supportive environment for each person entrusted to our care.”

</p>


      <p>Advocates had criticized Mr. Molina for reducing transparency at Rikers. During his tenure, officials stopped notifying the public when deaths occurred in custody and a jail oversight panel’s unrestricted access to Rikers Island video footage was revoked, though it was later restored.


</p>

   
      
       

      <p>Mr. Molina was not at the news conference on Friday, though Mr. Adams praised him. In the same status update that the mayor read from praising Ms. Maginley-Liddie, the monitor expressed concern that Mr. Molina, whom Mr. Adams recently appointed as the assistant deputy mayor of public safety, would still have oversight over the department.</p>

      <p>The Legal Aid Society said in a statement that “the current deteriorated state of the Department of Correction is well past the ability of a single commissioner to correct,” and that only an independent authority in the form of a receiver could secure the “systemic changes” required.
</p>

      <p>Mr. Navalny has been in custody in Russia since his detention in January 2021 in a Moscow airport, where he arrived after spending months in Germany, recovering from a poisoning by a nerve agent. Mr. Navalny blamed the Kremlin for the poisoning, but the Russian authorities denied their involvement.</p>
