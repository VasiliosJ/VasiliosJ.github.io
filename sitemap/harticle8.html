      <p>The narrow wooden benches in the student health clinic at Dire Dawa University in Ethiopia’s second-largest city began to fill up in March last year: feverish students slumped against their friends, cradling aching heads in their hands.</p>
    
      <p>Helen Asaminew, the presiding nurse, was baffled. The students had the hallmark symptoms of malaria. But people didn’t get malaria in cities, and the students hadn’t traveled anywhere. It was the dry season. There was no malaria for hundreds of miles.</p>

      <p>Yet when Ms. Asaminew had their blood tested, the telltale ring-shaped parasite signaling malaria turned up in most of the samples. By April, one out of every two students living in the male dormitories had the disease, 1,300 cases in all.</p>

      <p>The crowded clinic was the starting point of a medical mystery that forewarns an alarming new public health crisis in Africa. At its center is Anopheles stephensi, a malaria-carrying species of mosquito that arrived in the port city of the tiny East African nation of Djibouti a decade ago and was largely ignored by public health officials. It is resistant to all insecticides and has adapted to thrive in urban environments and survive in dry seasons. It is now breeding in locations across the center of the con</p>

      <p>Africa has expertise and strategies to fight malaria as a rural disease but now faces the threat of urban outbreaks, putting vastly more people at risk and threatening to wipe away recent progress against malaria, which still kills 620,000 people each year, mostly in Africa. Although some mosquito experts say it is too soon to be certain of the magnitude of the threat, the potential for outbreaks in cities, they fear, may set up a competition between urban and rural areas for scarce resources to fight the disease.



</p>

      <p>Stephensi breeds in water and thrives in congested cities, where unreliable piped-water systems often force people to store water around their homes, and poor trash collection provides ample spots (such as old bottle caps) for mosquitoes to lay eggs. The species is poised to descend on what public health experts describe as a largely malaria-naive human population: Most urban dwellers don’t have immunity from repeated prior exposure and may fall much sicker.



</p>


      <p>“It’s incredibly worrying: In places with stephensi established, we see cases going through the roof,” said Sarah Zohdy, who heads a task force on the invasive species for the U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative, a United States government program that fights malaria worldwide.

</p>

      <p>Africa is the least-urban continent, but also the one with the fastest-expanding cities: 50 percent of its population is projected to live in cities by 2030. Since emerging in Djibouti and Ethiopia, stephensi has been found in Kenya and Sudan, where the capital cities, Nairobi and Khartoum, are each home to about six million people, and in Nigeria, where the city of Lagos has a population of 16 million, double that of New York.
</p>


      <p>Researchers led by a University of Oxford entomologist assessed Africa for suitable habitat for stephensi and concluded that the species’s continued expansion puts an additional 126 million people at risk of malaria.</p>

   
      


      <p>Fredros Okumu, a Kenyan entomologist and influential thinker on malaria in Africa, said he was waiting for more data that conclusively showed stephensi was driving new cases; there has not been a spike in malaria cases everywhere it has been found, he said, a scientific puzzle that makes it difficult to predict the size of the risk it represents.</p>

      <p>Malaria causes high fevers, bone-shaking chills, fierce headaches and vomiting. Without treatment, it can be fatal. It hits small children hardest: They make up most of the 620,000 malaria deaths each year. If a mosquito feeds on a person who already has the parasite, the insect ingests it along with the person’s blood, and the parasite begins a new life cycle in the mosquito’s body. About a week later, if that mosquito bites someone new, it passes on the parasite with its saliva.
</p>

      <p>One of the biggest challenges with stephensi is that urban health care workers are often inexperienced in diagnosing malaria and can struggle to recognize the parasite in lab tests. Rural clinics, even community health volunteers, are well versed in spotting and diagnosing the disease. But city health care institutions may miss it. By the time people are properly diagnosed, they can be extremely ill.</p>

      <p>Shume Tolera, who lives in a middle-class neighborhood of Dire Dawa, an arid city of about a half-million people, developed a surging fever last April, when she was five months pregnant. When she went to the lab in the private hospital where she works as a nurse, staff members tested her blood for malaria. The results were negative. They tested her again and again as she got sicker over the coming week, and kept telling her she was negative.
