      <p>In the windowless basement of a Manhattan church last month, Bellevue Hospital hosted a fashion show.</p>
    
      <p>Dozens of weight-loss surgery patients, some in evening gowns, strutted down a red carpet. While their “before” photos were projected on a screen, an M.C. read testimonials about how the operations had remade their lives.</p>

      <p>Addressing the cheering crowd, Bellevue’s chief medical officer boasted about a remarkable number. The overwhelmed public hospital, which routinely treats gunshot and stabbing wounds, was on track to perform a record 3,000 weight-loss surgeries this year. “We have a lot to be proud of,” the executive, Dr. Nathan Link, said.</p>

      <p>Bariatric surgery is a major operation that, for the right patients, can ward off heart disease, diabetes and strokes. Bellevue, which serves a disproportionately poor and obese population, says the operations have saved many lives.</p>

      <p>But a New York Times investigation found that the bariatric program, led by surgeons with financial incentives to perform more operations, has become a high-speed assembly line that has endangered some patients and compromised urgent care for others. And because most of the hospital’s patients are on Medicaid or uninsured, taxpayers foot the bill.</p>

      <p>The surgery shrinks patients’ stomachs and requires them to radically change how and what they eat. Even some successful operations can lead to a lifetime of stomach cramps and debilitating acid reflux.</p>


      <p>For that reason, hospitals often require surgical candidates to try to lose weight on their own and go through months of screening and preparation for the procedure and its aftermath.</p>

      <p>Bellevue, however, frequently cuts corners as it hustles patients through the process, according to the Times investigation, which is based on interviews with 70 Bellevue employees, patients and executives from New York City’s hospital and correctional systems, as well as internal hospital documents, court filings and medical records.</p>

 </div>
      
       

      <p>Prospective patients often receive tentative surgery dates after attending a single informational session, filling out a worksheet and speaking briefly with a doctor. Meetings to assess patients’ mental health sometimes last just 10 minutes. Many patients said in interviews that they had agreed to surgeries without fully grasping the risks.</p>

      <p>In its zeal to increase volume, the hospital has operated on people whose body mass indexes were too low for them to qualify for surgery under standard medical guidelines, according to eight doctors and nurses involved in the operations. It has recruited patients from New York City’s Rikers Island jail complex who have virtually no chance of maintaining the required diets after surgery. Two prisoners told The Times that they had become malnourished and regretted having the operation.</p>
